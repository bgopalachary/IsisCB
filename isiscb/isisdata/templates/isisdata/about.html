    <h3>About <i>IsisCB Explore</i></h3>

    <p>
      <i>IsisCB Explore</i> is a research tool for the history of science, whose core dataset comes from bibliographical citations in the <a href="http://isisbibliography.org/">Isis Bibliography of the History of Science</a>. The IsisCB currently contains 40 years of citation data from 1974 to 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dataset is composed of two main types of records: <i>Citations</i>, items from the bibliography that have been classified and indexed, and <i>Authorities</i>, records that include both subject terms that classify citations as well as authors, publishers, and journals that have written and published those works.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>IsisCB Explore</i> blends a professionally curated database with social media tools, so that the community can play a more active role in building a tool that will cater to its needs. User participation is encouraged. Please sign-in and provide comments to entries where you see errors and add further information where relevant. Suggest hyperlinks and other material that will be useful for fellow scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you run into problems with the tool itself, please use the Feedback link. If you have specific comments on the content of records, you can add those directly to the record itself, using the commenting function, or you can email us at <a href="mailto:isisbibliography@gmail.com">isisbibliography@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are fully committed to open access. Our data is available via a <a href="{% url 'rest_root' %}">REST API</a> (accessible through the icons on this site), and all of our source code is at <a href="https://github.com/upconsulting/IsisCB">GitHub</a>. Our data is open for use following the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

    <h4>Development schedule</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        More data, including web-based resources from the World History of Science Online, all bibliographical citations from the 1913-1975 Isis Cumulative Bibliographies, and conference presentation citations from selected conferences.
      </li>
      <li>
        More user account functions, such as adding entries, curating pages, saving marked sets of citations.
      </li>
      <li>
        More nuanced indexing, including merging of identical authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        More information about authority records, drawn from places like DBPedia.
      </li>
      <li>
        More linked resources, including authority links to places such as the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
      </li>
      <li>
